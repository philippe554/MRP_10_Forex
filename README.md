# MRP_10_Forex
Trading in Forex can lead to profit if you react well (by buying and selling money) to dynamic
changes in the exchange rates. However, forecasting of the Forex market is very difficult,
due to its size, dispersion, and continuous operation. Therefore, the goal of this
project is to investigate whether neural networks and deep learning can be used to achieve
an accurate data-driven forecast of the Forex market.
